# Android-LocationAPI

This app allows users to:
- see their current location on the map along with their longitude and latitude 
- set/save other pins on the map along with a description
- proximity alert features ( In case that the user aproaches some points that are set along with a proximity alert, the user will be notified that he has entered a certain area close to that point). 
The app also provides the possibility to change the view of the map from normal to hybrid and vice-versa.
